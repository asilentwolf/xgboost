XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly *efficient*, *flexible* and *portable*.
It implements machine learning algorithms under the [Gradient Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) framework.
XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting(also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.
The same code runs on major distributed environment(Hadoop, SGE, MPI) and can solve problems beyond billions of examples.
XGBoost is part of [DMLC](http://dmlc.github.io/) projects.
